# Game1

Game1 is an untitled exploration into creating a turn based game inspired by other games like Civilization, Polytopia, and Mount and Blade. 

More than just a new game in that style though, it is an exploration into AI assisted development. ChatGPT inspired some of the code here, although it did not write any of the code.

To play, simply launch index.html from the root folder.
